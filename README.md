# Heuristic Optimization Methods

This repository contains implementations and experiments for several problems and approaches in the field of heuristic / metaheuristic optimization. Each topic is organized into its own directory (module).

The problems originate from the [Heuristic Optimization Methods course at FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/hom).

## Contents

- `cvrptw/` – solving the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)**
- `grasp/` – experiments / implementation related to **GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure)**
- `quadassign/` – solving the **Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)**

Each directory is designed as a self-contained unit (code, instances/inputs, run scripts, results, etc.).

## Goals

- compare different heuristics / metaheuristics,
- explore the impact of parameters (e.g., RCL size, number of iterations, random seed),
- obtain good (not necessarily optimal) solutions within reasonable time.
- do the necessary lab work to finish my degree :D
